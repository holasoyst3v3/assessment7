One observation is that depending on how large an array is, the longer each run through will takeno matter which function is used. The doubleAppend is better because looking at the tiny, small and medium arrays, the times are reltivley close and steady unlike doubleInsert which increases dramatically seen in small to medium to large array.

Append uses PUSH, which adds to the end of a given array. Insert on the other hand takes longer becuase it uses UNSHIFT which adds to the front of a given array, essentially making a copy of the original array.
